# Cloud-Computing-final-project
This is the final project for Cloud Computing 2020


This project consists the process of building a containerized machine learning prediction model and deploy it in a scalable, and elastic platform.

The elastic scale-up performance is tested via Load Test with Locust, this project starts with 1 container or endpoint and verify 2 or more inference endpoints scale
up to 1K requests per second.

There's also a demo video showing project scaling up to 1k+ requests served by multiple endpoints that scale-up.
